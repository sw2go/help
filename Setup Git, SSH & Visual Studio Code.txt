Normal Setup on Windows
-----------------------
download & install visual source code
 - command palette "Sprache konfigurieren" i.e. "locale":"en-US" 

download & install git and set following Options:
 - use visual source code as git default editor
 - use git from the windows command prompt
 - use open ssh
 - use the native Windows Secure Channel library ( not ca-bundle.crt )
 - use MinTTY
 - no credential manager

Hints:
$ is the "linux" prompt (Git Bash terminal)
~ is the "linux" users directory i.e: C:\Users\yourusername
> is the windows prompt (cmd or powershell) 
 
set a global git username  ( saved to ~/.gitconfig )
> git config --global user.name aa 

to create a default (id_rsa) sshKey run Git Bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C yourname@yourcomputer

show public key and past content to the SSH-Keys of your online-github account 
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

test ssh connection       
$ ssh -T git@github.com	  ... with default settings (i.e. key-filename id_rsa)
$ ssh -T git@myhostalias  ... with special settings in ~/.ssh/config for myhostalias 

go to the folder where you want the local repository to be created in
> cd C:\MyRepositories
> git clone ssh://git@github.com/sw2go/help.git    ... this creates a subfolter 'help'

if you cloned by accident with the https url, i.e. https://github.com/sw2go/help.git
cloning works, because the repository is a public one, but pushing would fail
To use ssh go into the local repository folder and set the remote origin to the ssh-url
> git remote set-url origin ssh://git@github.com/sw2go/help.git  ... or edit ./git/config manually

open folder C:\@github\help from visual source code
change files, save stage and commit from the Explorer-Tab then use
View > Command Palette for > Git: Pull or Push

normally one id_rsa per user and computer is sufficient.
if your pc gets stolen or you throw it away just remove the public key from the github account. 


Several sshKeys and Alias
-------------------------
if you want or must use more than one sshKey here is how to do it:

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C blabla -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.forXY

show public key and past content to the SSH-Keys of your online-github account 
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.forXY.pub

to tell ssh what key to take and define an alias for github.com edit config

$ nano ~/.ssh/config
  Host gh
       Hostname github.com
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.forXY
       IdentitiesOnly yes

clone repository by using alias gh
c:> git clone ssh://git@gh/sw2go/help.git C:\@github\help
