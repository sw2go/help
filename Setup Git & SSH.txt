Hints:
$ is the "linux" prompt (Git Bash terminal)
~ is the "linux" users directory /home/yourusername (on windows C:\Users\yourusername) 
> is the windows prompt (cmd or powershell) 

setup git for windows
---------------------

download & install git and set following Options:
 - use visual source code as git default editor
 - use git from the windows command prompt
 - use open ssh
 - use the native Windows Secure Channel library ( not ca-bundle.crt )
 - use MinTTY
 - no credential manager
 
set a global git username  ( saved to ~/.gitconfig )
> git config --global user.name aa 

to create a default (id_rsa) sshKey run Git Bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C yourname@yourcomputer ... (you can use any mail-address-like string)  

show public key and past content to the SSH-Keys of your online-github or azure.devops account 
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

test ssh connection, to see if authentication is succeeding (works in git bash terminal only)
$ ssh -T git@github.com	  ... with default settings (i.e. key-filename id_rsa)
$ ssh -T git@myhostalias  ... with special settings in ~/.ssh/config for myhostalias 

go to the folder where you want the local repository to be created
> cd C:\MyRepositories
> git clone ssh://git@github.com/sw2go/help.git    ... this creates the repository 'help' in a subfolder

https vs. ssh
-------------
if you cloned by accident with the https url, i.e. https://github.com/sw2go/help.git
cloning works, because the repository is a public one, but pushing will fail.
To use ssh, get the ssh-url of your online repository at github.com or dev.azure.com (see "clone" url) 
Then go into the local repository folder and set the remote origin to the ssh-url you found online.
> git remote set-url origin ssh://git@github.com/sw2go/help.git  ... or edit ./git/config manually

normally one id_rsa per user and computer is sufficient.
if your PC gets stolen or you throw it away just remove the public key from the github account. 


setup git server on windows

different ssh-keys and custom settings for some hosts
-----------------------------------------------------
if you want or must use more than one sshKey here is how to do it:

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C blabla -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.forXY

show public key and past content to the SSH-Keys of your online-github account 
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.forXY.pub

to configure ssh to use special settings for a host connection, open ~/.ssh/config 
create a new host-section with a host alias i.e. myAlias and set the parameters required.

$ nano ~/.ssh/config

  Host myAlias
       Hostname github.com
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.forXY
       IdentitiesOnly yes

to use the settings, use the host alias in the url
> git clone ssh://git@myAlias/sw2go/help.git
