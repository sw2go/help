To handle several node-versions use nvm for windows.
https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows

nvm -v                 ... show installed version of nvm

nvm ls                 ... list all available npm version

nvm current            ... show current npm version

nvm install 18.16.1    ... install specific npm version

nvm use 18.16.1        ... switch to specific npm version


If you need a specific node (npm) version in a project:

Go to the project folder, there where you find the package.json i.e. ClientApp
Switch to or install and switch to the required node version by using nvm
Next ensure that the projects node modules are in sync with package.json 

npm install            ... this updates the content of the node_modules folder

to run a script defined in package.json call

npm run <scriptname>   ... you can also pass additional parameter i.e.

npm run ng serve       ... this calls the npm script "ng" that calls node "ng" 
                           defined in angular-cli with the argument "serve"
